Hi! I'm working on a professional-grade, modular Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) software suite. The software is designed to control **custom-built hardware** (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, stepper motors, actuators, etc.) and includes **simulation and real hardware control modes**. It’s inspired by the software quality and architecture of companies like Bruker, Nanonis, and ScientaOmicron, but it's built for **open, flexible, and extensible lab hardware**.

The project is structured as follows:

```
SPM-Software/
├── main.py
├── config/                  # Centralized configuration
├── hardware/                # Hardware abstraction (Arduino, RPi, etc.)
├── control/                 # Motion, feedback, signal generation
├── scan_engine/             # STM, AFM scan logic
├── simulation/              # Physics-based simulation models
├── gui/                     # GUI logic and tabs
├── data/                    # Data storage, processing, visualization
├── utils/                   # Logging and helper functions
├── static/                  # Web assets (CSS, JS, images)
├── template/                # HTML templates
├── tests/                   # Unit and integration tests
├── docs/                    # Developer and user documentation
```

I’ve already created the folder and file structure using a Python script. Please continue helping me from here — for example, by generating code for modules like `hardware/base_controller.py`, `config/settings.py`, or anything else I ask next.
